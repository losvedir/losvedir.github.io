    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    Scratch notes:

    hello world os x llvm

    use llvm ir as a pseudo-assembly.

    Download tools: http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.4.2
    Even though it says "Clang", it's really the whole suite of tools.

    "Hello World" module in IR: http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#module-structure
    save it as hello.ll

    You may have to delete the last "foo" line, if the next step gives you trouble.

    Compile the ll file to native assembly:

        $ [CLANG]/bin/llc hello.ll

    This will produce a hello.s file. Compile that to machine code:

        $ gcc hello.s

    Run the native executable:

        $ ./a.out
